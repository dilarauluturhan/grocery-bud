## About The Project
![](https://github.com/dilarauluturhan/grocery-bud/assets/120499369/d508881d-4804-47f1-be47-9b74386498df)

## Features
This project aims to create and organize grocery shopping list. Users can add, delete and edit the products they want through the interface in the project. I also included edit and delete icons in the project using the React Icons library so that the user experience becomes more impressive. Among the methods I used in this project are the basic features of React.js such as useState, useEffect and event handling. Thanks to these features, user interactions can be managed dynamically and the application can be kept up-to-date.

## Design
In this project, I used Pure CSS for the design.

## Built With
I created this project using the React.js and React Icons.
